Built a same page web application using react and its router as well as Bootstrap and Material-UI.
http://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1 is the URL to the API.
Data about players, teams and games is presented to the user by navigating through the app.
The data we can see includes team rosters, player stats, and game scores.
These features were chosen to be shown to give a user insight on how players are doing, who is on each team, and how a team performed in a game.
The site is viewable on GitHub Pages at http://slayer50169.github.io/MLBCapstone
